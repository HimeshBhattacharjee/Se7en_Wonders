                        This mausoleum complex in Agra, India, is regarded as one of the world's most
                        iconic monuments and is perhaps the finest example of Mughal architecture. It
                        was built by Emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628-58) to honor his wife Mumtāz Maḥal
                        who died in 1631 giving birth to their 14th child. It took about 22 years and
                        20,000 workers to construct the complex.

                        One of the world's largest building-construction projects, the Great Wall of China is widely
                        thought to be about 5,500 miles (8,850 km) long. Work began in the 7th century BCE and continued
                        for two millennia. Although called a “wall,” the structure actually features two parallel walls
                        for lengthy stretches.

                        Christ the Redeemer, a colossal statue of Jesus, stands atop Mount Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro.
                        Its origins date to just after World War I, when some Brazilians feared a “tide of godlessness.”
                        They proposed a statue, which was ultimately designed by Heitor da Silva Costa, Carlos Oswald,
                        and Paul Landowski. Construction began in 1926 and was completed five years later.

                        The Colosseum in Rome was built in the first century by order of the Emperor Vespasian. A feat of
                        engineering, the amphitheater measures 620 by 513 feet and features a complex system of vaults.
                        It was capable of holding 50,000 spectators, who watched a variety of events. Perhaps most notable
                        were gladiator fights, though men battling animals was also common.

                        Chichén Itzá is a Mayan city on the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. Among the most notable is the stepped pyramid
                        El Castillo (“The Castle”), which rises 79 feet (24 meters) above the Main Plaza. A testament to the Mayans'
                        astronomical abilities, the structure features a total of 365 steps, the number of days in the solar year. During
                        the spring and autumnal equinoxes, the setting sun casts shadows on the pyramid that give the appearance of a serpent
                        slithering down the north stairway; at the base is a stone snake head.

                        The ancient city of Petra, Jordan was purported to be one of the places where Moses struck a rock and water gushed forth.

                        center, especially for spices. The Nabataeans chiseled dwellings, temples, and tombs into the sandstone, which changed color
                        with the shifting sun. In addition, they constructed a water system that allowed for lush gardens and farming.
